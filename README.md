# SPACES_Dashboard

Global Positioning System (GPS) based mobility data has increasingly been utilized by researchers from psychological domain in combination with Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) to elucidate individuals’ affects and behaviors in environmental contexts on a daily basis. However, there has not been a user-friendly tool for visualization that integrates data of individual surveys with GPS traces. To fill this gap, we develop an interactive dashboard which enables psychological researchers to observe the spatiotemporal patterns of individual participants’ emotions and behaviors cast in geographic contexts. 

The dashboard consists of three major components: file upload portal, data explorer, and map panel.
- In the file upload portal, users will be asked to upload datasets to be analyzed.
- In the data explorer, uploaded datasets can be previewed.
- The map panel has three tabs. The first and second tabs are for visualizing emotion events and environmental contexts respectively. The third tab provides an all-in-one map view where users can create any combination of features that they want to investigate based on built-in functionalities.

For demonstration purpose, sample datasets from an EMA survey have been incorporated. This interactive dashboard will help psychologists understand survey data with everything only one-click away, and may contribute to clinical studies of psychology with an opportunity to obtain novel insights from a spatiotemporal perspective.
